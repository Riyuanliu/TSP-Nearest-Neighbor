# TSP Solver using Nearest Neighbor Algorithm (C++)

This C++ program solves the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using the Nearest Neighbor algorithm. It takes a set of cities with their coordinates as input and finds the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Input file containing city coordinates (format: one city per line, each line containing x and y coordinates separated by space)

### Running the Program
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler:
